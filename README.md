**Abstract:**

Due to the level of Internet penetration already exists today, mobile networks must provide wider range of coverage and improved performance. With the use of Machine learning (ML), developments and potential capabilities, is being considered as a replacement for the conventional methods for predicting ground-to-ground (G2G) mobile communication coverage. 
This study is made to help the students and faculties of VIT Chennai to identify the spots inside the campus where their network performance is good. The performance of the network is determined by many factors like distance between the user and antenna, height ratio between the user and the cell tower, and so on. 
All these parameters are generated with respect to the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) value for that corresponding checkpoint inside the campus. The trained dataset is imported into CloudRF for the visualization output of this project.

**Keywords:**

Machine Learning,	CloudRF, Wireless Communication, Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI).
